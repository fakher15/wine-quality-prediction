# wine-quality-prediction
Using classification model with python to predict the wine quality according to its ingredients 

## some notes

in classification_model.py file you have to change every path to your's so the model can read the dataset <br>

you can try prediction by using the website created by django , it's a simple form which contains inputs for every ingredient of the wine . <br>

thanks for trying this .
